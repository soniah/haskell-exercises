-- Week 6: Monads
--
-- Monads are a famously hard topic in learning Haskell. My
-- advise is to try different approaches to understanding
-- monads while writing as much code as possible. Merely
-- contemplating various metaphors for monads will not lead to
-- understanding.
--
-- I recommend starting at these exercises only once you've
-- read a bit about monads. The two standard monads the
-- exercises will use are Maybe and State. Maybe is simple
-- enough, but State requires some looking at.
--
-- If you've yet to find a monad guide to your liking, try
-- Learn You A Haskell For Great Good. The monad chapter is
-- here:
--
-- http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads
--
-- But you should probably browse through the previous chapter
-- about Functos too. The State monad is introduced a bit
-- later:
--
-- http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more#state


-- Ex 1: let's use the Maybe type to talk about computations
-- that can fail. A value of type "a -> Maybe b" takes an
-- argument of type a and can either succesfully return a
-- value of type b, or fail and return Nothing.
--
-- Here is the operator ?> that defines the natural way of
-- chaining computations like this. We get the result of the
-- previous computation (Maybe a) and the next computation (a
-- -> Maybe b) and return the new result (Maybe b):

(?>) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
Nothing ?> _ = Nothing   -- In case of failure, propagate failure
Just x  ?> f = f x       -- In case of sucess, run the next computation

-- Your task is to help implement the function readName that
-- given a string like "Forename Surname" produces the pair
-- ("Forname", "Surname"). readName should fail (return
-- Nothing) in the following cases:
--
--   1. the input string doesn't contain a space
--   2. one of the names contains numbers
--   3. one of the names doesn't start with a capital letter
--
-- The function readNames has already been implemented using
-- ?>. You need to define the functions split, checkNumber and
-- checkCapitals so that readNames works correctly.

-- DO NOT touch this definition!
readNames :: String -> Maybe (String,String)
readNames s =
  split s
  ?>
  checkNumber
  ?>
  checkCapitals

-- split should split a string into two words. If the input
-- doesn't contain a space, Nothing should be returned
--
-- (NB! There are obviously other corner cases like the inputs
-- " " and "a b c", but you don't need to worry about those
-- here)

-- soln: break - Prelude, 'Sublists'
-- soln: case + pattern matching!!!

split :: String -> Maybe (String,String)
split s =
    if (length $ filter isSpace s) > 0 then
        let w1 = takeWhile (not . isSpace) s
            w2 = tail $ dropWhile (not . isSpace) s
        in Just (w1, w2)
    else
        Nothing

-- checkNumber should take a pair of two strings and return
-- then unchanged if they don't contain numbers. Otherwise
-- Nothing is returned.

-- soln: all (and any)

checkNumber :: (String, String) -> Maybe (String, String)
checkNumber (s1,s2) =
    let hasN s = (length $ filter isDigit s) > 0
    in  if (hasN s1) || (hasN s2) then Nothing
        else Just (s1,s2)

-- checkCapitals should take a pair of two strings and return
-- them unchanged if both start with a capital letter.
-- Otherwise Nothing is returned.

-- soln: !! syntax for lists

checkCapitals :: (String, String) -> Maybe (String, String)
checkCapitals (s1,s2) =
    let hasC s = (isUpper $ head s)
    in  if (hasC s1) && (hasC s2) then Just (s1,s2)
        else Nothing

-- Ex 2: implement a function myTake that works just like
-- take, but
--   1. the arguments are of types Maybe Int and Maybe [a]
--   2. if either of the arguments is Nothing, Nothing is
--   returned
--   3. if the Int is larger than the length of the list,
--   Nothing is returned
--
-- Use the Maybe monad, i.e. the >>= operator or do-notation.
--
-- DO NOT use pattern matching for Maybe.
--
-- Examples:
--  myTake (Just 2) (Just [5,6,7])
--    ==> Just [5,6]
--  myTake Nothing (Just [5,6,7])
--    ==> Nothing
--  myTake (Just 2) Nothing
--    ==> Nothing
--  myTake (Just 4) (Just [5,6,7])
--    ==> Nothing

-- soln: when (!!). Also unless, guard.

myTake :: Maybe Int -> Maybe [a] -> Maybe [a]
myTake mi ml = do
    i <- mi
    l <- ml
    if length l >= i then
        return $ take i l
    else

-- Ex 3: given a list of indices and a list of values, return
-- the sum of the values in the given indices. You should fail
-- if any of the indices is too large or too small.
--
-- Use the Maybe monad, i.e. the >>= operator or do-notation.
--
-- DO NOT use pattern matching for Maybe.
--
-- Hint! implementa a function safeIndex :: [a] -> Int ->
-- Maybe a
--
-- Examples:
--  selectSum [0..10] [4,6,9]
--    Just 19
--  selectSum [0..10] [4,6,9,20]
--    Nothing

-- soln:
-- mapM     :: Monad m  => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
-- liftM    :: Monad m  => (a1 -> r) -> m a1 -> m r
-- sum      :: Num a    => [a] -> a
-- selectSum xs is = liftM sum $ mapM (safeIndex xs) is

selectSum :: Num a => [a] -> [Int] -> Maybe a
selectSum _ [] = Just 0
selectSum xs (i:is) = do
    val <- safeIndex xs i
    sum <- selectSum xs is
    return (val + sum)

-- !! is zero-based, length isn't
safeIndex :: [a] -> Int -> Maybe a
safeIndex xs n =
    if (n < length xs) && (n >= 0)
        then Just(xs!!n)
        else Nothing

-- Ex 4: below you'll find the implementation of a Logger
-- monad and some examples of its use.
--
-- Your task is to implement a function binom that computes
-- binomial coefficients recursively with the following
-- formulae:
--
--   B(n,0) = 1
--   B(0,k) = 0, kun k>0
--   B(n,k) = B(n-1,k-1) + B(n-1,k)
--
-- Every call to the function should be logged as "B(n,k)".
-- Invocations should be logged in execution order.
--
-- Examples:
--   binom 0 0 ==> Logger ["B(0,0)"] 1
--   binom 0 7 ==> Logger ["B(0,7)"] 0
--   binom 1 1 ==> Logger ["B(0,0)","B(0,1)","B(1,1)"] 1
--   binom 2 2 ==> Logger ["B(0,0)","B(0,1)","B(1,1)","B(0,1)","B(0,2)","B(1,2)","B(2,2)"] 1

-- Ex 5: using the State monad, write the operation update
-- that first multiplies the state by 2 and then adds one to
-- it. The state has type Int.
--
-- Example:
--  runState update 3
--    ==> ((),7)

update :: State Int ()
update = do
    n <- get
    put (n*2+1)

-- Ex 6: using the State monad, walk through a list and
-- increment the state by one each time a given element is
-- encountered. Additionally you should return the length of
-- the list.
--
-- Do this by implementing a recursive State operation
-- lengthAndCount.  Do not use the functions length or filter.
--
-- Example:
--  runState (lengthAndCount True
--  [False,True,False,True,False]) 0
--    ==> (5,2)

lengthAndCount :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> State Int Int
lengthAndCount x ys = undefined

-- Ex 7: using a state of type [(a,Int)] we can keep track of
-- the numbers of occurrences of eleemnents of type a. For
-- instance [('a',1),('x',3)] means that we've seen one 'a'
-- and three 'x's.
--
-- Implement an State monad operation count that registers the
-- occurrence of the given value.
--
-- Examples:
--  runState (count True) []
--    ==> ((),[(True,1)])
--  runState (count 7) []
--    ==> ((),[(7,1)])
--  runState (count 'a') [('a',1),('b',3)]
--    ==> ((),[('a',2),('b',3)])
--
-- PS. Order of the list of pairs doesn't matter

count :: Eq a => a -> State [(a,Int)] ()
count x = return ()

-- Ex 8: goven a list of values, replace each value by a
-- number saying which occurrence of the value this was in the
-- list.
--
-- Do this in the State monad, using the operation count you
-- just defined.
--
-- Hint: the function lookup will help
--
-- Examples:
--  runState (occurrences [True,True,True,False,False]) []
--    ==> ([1,2,3,1,2],[(True,3),(False,2)])
--  runState (occurrences [5,5,6,6,5,6,7]) []

occurrences :: (Eq a) => [a] -> State [(a,Int)] [Int]
occurrences xs = undefined

-- Ex 9: implement the function ifM, that takes three monadic
-- operations. If the first of the operations returns True,
-- the second operation should be run. Otherwise the third
-- operation should be run.
--
-- Examples (test is defined below):
--  runState (put 11 >> ifM test (return 'a') (return 'b')) 0
--    ==> ('b',11)
--  runState (put 9 >> ifM test (return 'a') (return 'b')) 0

ifM :: Monad m => m Bool -> m a -> m a -> m a

-- Ex 10: the standard library function Control.Monad.mapM
-- defines a monadic map operation. Some examples of using it
-- (safeDiv is define below):
--
-- mapM (safeDiv 10.0) [1.0,5.0,2.0]  =>  Just [10.0,2.0,5.0]
-- mapM (safeDiv 10.0) [1.0,0.0,2.0]  =>  Nothing
--
-- Your task is to implement the function mapM2 that works
-- like mapM, but there are two lists and the operation takes
-- two arguments. If the lists are of different lists, you can
-- stop processing them once the shorter one ends.
--
-- Examples:
--  mapM2 (\x y -> Just (x+y)) [1,2,3] [6,7]
--    ==> Just [7,9]
--  runState (mapM2 (\x y -> if x then modify (+y) else return
--  () ) [True,False,True] [1,2,4]) 0
--    ==> ([(),(),()],5)

-- Ex 11: Funnykiztan has cities that are named with by
-- 0..n-1. Some cities are connected by roads. Your task is to
-- find out if you can can get from city A to city B by
-- following the roads.
--
-- The road network is given as an adjacency list, which means
-- a list of lists [[Int]] where the i'th list gives the
-- citices to wich city i has a road to.
--
-- For example the road network:
--
-- 0--1
-- |\ |
-- | \|
-- 2--3
--
-- would be represented as:
--  [[1,2,3]
--  ,[0,3]
--  ,[0,3]
--  ,[0,1,2]]
--
-- Below you'll find the function routeExists that solves the
-- task.  However a very important piece of the function, the
-- helper function dfs is still unimplemented.
--
-- The function dfs is intended to run a Depth-First Search.
-- If you don't know what this means, have a look in
-- wikipedia.
--
-- Simply put, dfs uses roads to travel from city to city
-- using roads, using a state of type [Int] to keep track of
-- which cities have been visited. This is important because
-- the road network will have cycles.
--
-- Examples:
--   routeExists example1 0 2  ==> True
--   routeExists example2 0 2  ==> True
--   routeExists example2 3 5  ==> False
--   runState (dfs example2 0) []  ==> ((),[2,3,1,0])
-- When 1 and 2 have already been visited, dfs won't proceed
-- to city 3:
--   runState (dfs example1 0) [1,2] ==> ((),[0,1,2])
--
-- A word on tests. The tests first test the function dfs in a
-- couple of simple situations. After this they test the
-- function routeExists more extensively. The tests look at
-- the state produced by dfs but do not care in which order it
-- is.

-- Three cities, each connected to the two others

-- Ex 12: define the function orderedPairs that returns all

--
-- Use the list monad!

--
-- Esimerkkejä:

--     ==> [0]

-- Ex 14: the standard library defines the function
--
--   foldM :: (Monad m) => (a -> b -> m a) -> a -> [b] -> m a
--
-- This function behaves like foldr, but the operation used is
-- monadic. foldM f acc xs works by running f for each element
-- in xs, giving it also the result of the previous invocation
-- of f.
--
-- Your task is to implement the functions f1 and f2 so that
-- the functions sumBounded and sumNotTwice work.

-- sumBounded computes the sum of a list. However if some
-- prefix of the list has a sum of over k, Nothing is
-- returned.
--
-- Examples:
--  sumBounded 5 [1,2,1,-2,3]
--    ==> Just 5
--  sumBounded 5 [1,2,3,1,-2]
--    ==> Nothing

--    ==> 1
--  sumNotTwice [1,2,-2,3]
--    ==> 4
sumNotTwice :: [Int] -> Int

-- Ex 15: here is the Result type from last week. Implement a
-- Monad Result instance that behaves roughly like the Monad
-- Maybe instance.
--
-- That is,
--   1. MkResults behave like Just
--   2. If part of computation produces NoResult, the whole
--   computation produces NoResult (just like Nothing)
--   3. Similarly, if we get a Failure "reason" value, the
--   whole computation produces Failure "reason"
--
-- Additionally, the method "fail" of the Monad type class
-- should produce a Failure.
--
-- Examples:
--   MkResult 1 >> Failure "boom" >> MkResult 2
--     ==> Failure "boom"
--   MkResult 1 >> NoResult >> Failure "not reached"
--     ==> NoResult
--   MkResult 1 >>= (\x -> MkResult (x+1))

-- Ex 16: Here is the type SL that combines the State and

--
-- To simplify the type signatures, the type of the state has
-- been set to Int, instead of being a parameter like in the
